  <h1 align="center">Chess in Java | Scacchi in Java</h1>
</p>

This is a chess implementation done in Java as a school project. The requirements were usage of the MVC Java development paradigm, with the usage of threads. Most of the comments and text are in Italian, but in the future we may come back to the project and fix bugs. The main issue as of now is bad optimization. The code could be a thousand times better, unfortunately I don't have the time to work on it. Feel free to download and play around with the code!
